	<h1>The Great Suspender :: New Version is Out!</h1>
	<p>
		First things first. You may notice that any tabs you had suspended before the upgrade have now disappeared. Sorry about this! It's an unfortunate side-effect of how the tab suspension works. The good news is you can go to the <a href='history'>history</a> page and reload these missing tabs back into your browser.
        <br />
        There has been a lot of changes made since the last version. Most notably some bug fixes around the auto-suspend feature, and the whitelisting functionality.

        <br />
        - Chrome sync support. Suspended tabs will now appear normally over chrome sync.
        - Improved error recovery. You will not lose your tabs if the extension restarts or is uninstalled.
        - Introduced an option to never suspend pinned tabs.
        - New 1 minute and 5 minute options for time to auto-suspend.
        - Ability to choose image quality of screen preview.
        - Can now prevent tabs with a half-completed form from suspending and losing your entered text.
        - New option to force a cache refresh when reloading a tab.
        - New recovery screen that more accurately restores previous sessions as well as a configurable number of sessions to save.
        -
