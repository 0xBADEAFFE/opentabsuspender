	<h1>The Great Suspender - New Version is Out!</h1>
	
        <p>You've just updated to a shiny new version of The Great Suspender.
        Before I get into what's new, I would like to apologise for any suspended tabs that may have just disappeared from your browser. It is an unfortunate side-effect of installing this new release. However, these tabs should be able to be recovered from the <a href='history'>history</a> page. And the good news is that this new release has fixed the issue meaning upgrades from now on in should be smooth sailing!</p>
        
        <p>This new version comes with a lot of new features and some much requested bug fixes. Sorry they've taken so long.</p>
        <h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
        <ul class="unorderedList">
            <li>Fixed a bug around whitelisting not working correctly.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with the extension not obeying the requested suspension timeouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New Features:</h2>
        <ul class="unorderedList">
            <li>Full support for chrome syncing! This means that all your options and whitelisted tabs will be synced across all your logged in chrome browsers. You will also be able to load suspended tabs from your synced history.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Useability Improvements:</h2>
        <ul class="unorderedList">
            <li>Chrome sync support. Suspended tabs will now appear normally over chrome sync.</li>
            <li>Improved error recovery. You will not lose your tabs if the extension restarts or is uninstalled.</li>
            <li>Introduced an option to never suspend pinned tabs.</li>
            <li>New 1 minute and 5 minute options for time to auto-suspend.</li>
            <li>Ability to choose image quality of screen preview.</li>
            <li>Can now prevent tabs with a half-completed form from suspending and losing your entered text.</li>
            <li>New option to force a cache refresh when reloading a tab.</li>
            <li>New recovery screen that more accurately restores previous sessions as well as a configurable number of </li>sessions to save.
        </ul>
