	<h1>The Great Suspender :: New Version is Out!</h1>
	<p>
		First things first. You may notice that any tabs you had suspended before the upgrade have now disappeared. Sorry about this! It's an unfortunate side-effect of how the tab suspension works. The good news is you can go to the <a href='history'>history</a> page and reload these missing tabs back into your browser.
        <br />
        There has been a lot of changes made since the last version. Most notably some bug fixes around the auto-suspend feature, and the whitelisting functionality.

        <br />
        - Introduced an option to never suspend pinned tabs.
