	<h1>The Great Suspender :: Recovery</h1>

	<p>
		The Great Suspender has just recovered from a restart which will have caused any tabs currently suspended to disappear.
		<br />
		This is common after an extension update or a chrome crash. 
		<br />
		Below is a list of tabs that were in suspension before the restart. 
		<br />
		You can unsuspend them all together or one at a time from the links below.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Suspended Tabs:
		<a id='resuspendLink' href='#' class='groupLink' title="Reopen all tabs in a suspended state">resuspend all tabs</a>
		<a id='unsuspendLink' href='#' class='groupLink' title="Reopen all tabs in an unsuspended state">reload all tabs</a>
		<a id='historyLink' href='#' class='groupLink' title="Goto the History page">view history</a>
		<a id='clearLink' href='#' class='groupLink' title="Remove these tabs from history">clear results</a>
	</h2>
	<ul id='recoveryLinks'></ul>
	<br />
	<p>
		Important: If you are seeing this page repeatedly, then something may be wrong with the extension.
		<br />
		Please let me know so that I can attempt to repair the problem.
