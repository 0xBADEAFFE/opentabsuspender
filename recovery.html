	<h1>The Great Suspender :: Recovery</h1>
	<br />
	<p>
		It appears that The Great Suspender has either just been updated, reloaded or has recovered from a crash.
		<br />
		You had <span id='suspendedCount'></span> tabs in suspension.
		<ul> 
			<li><a id='resuspendLink' href='#'>Resuspend these tabs</a> (will reload tabs in a suspended state)</li>
			<li><a id='unsuspendLink' href='#'>Unsuspend these tabs</a> (will reload tabs in an unsuspended state)</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		Alternatively, you can go to the <a id='historyLink' href='#'>history tab</a> where you can view all tabs that
		you have previously suspended and selectively reload from there.
